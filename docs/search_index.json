Install the RStudio IDE (you need a version higher than 1.0.0) Install the R package bookdown: # stable version on CRAN install.packages(&#39;bookdown&#39;) # or development version on GitHub # devtools::install_github(&#39;rstudio/bookdown&#39;) You should now have a folder called bookdown-demo-master which contains exemple chapters, an index and files needed for the Bookdown. In the Bookdown-demo-master folder Create a folder called docs and leave it empty Look for a file called _bookdown.yml Open the file Add output_dir: \"docs\" Exemple : book_filename: &quot;YOUR BOOK NAME HERE&quot; delete_merged_file: true language: ui: chapter_name: output_dir: &quot;docs&quot; 2.2 Github Repository Create a repository online Create a repository on Github where you will host your Bookdown (exemple test_book) Copy the repository link generated by Github Clone the newly created repository on your computer Open a terminal window Navigate to the folder where you want to have your Bookdown To clone your repository use the command git clone Exemple : git clone https://github.com/karinevilleneuve/test_book.git In this exemple, the Github link would be replaced by the link you copied earlier. 2.3 From Bookdown to Github Copy the entire content of the Bookdown folder into the new folder create by cloning the repository. In this case this folder is called test_book Now you can start modifying the content of your book by opening each chapter. What is now very important is that, once you knit your R Markdown, the ouput HTML will be created into the folder docs (the one we created earlier). This is important because Github will use the files from the folder docs to generate the Github page. 2.4 Knit and upload to github To upload your Bookdown to your github Buil book Open the file with the extension .Rproj Click on Buil Book under the Build tab on the right If you navigate to the folder docs you should now see that it contains a HTML copy of every chapter Update your online repository Open a terminal window and navigate to the repository folder now containing all the bookdown file Write the following command in order git status git add -f * git commit git push Go to your online Github repository, all the files and folders from your local folder should be there Go to Settings Scroll down to the section Github Pages Click on button None and from the dropdown menu select Master Click the /(root) button and from the dropdown menu select /(docs) Click Save The page will refresh, and now if you scroll back down to the section Github Pages you will see the URL of your Book Exemple Voilà "]
