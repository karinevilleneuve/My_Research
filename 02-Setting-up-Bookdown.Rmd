# Host Bookdown on Github

Before anything, I highly suggest going through [Bookdown: Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) in order to understand the basics to setting up your own bookdown.

## Getting Bookdown started 

1. Download the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown-demo) as a Zip file, then unzip it locally.

2. Install the RStudio IDE. Note that you need a version higher than 1.0.0. Please download the latest version if your RStudio version is lower than 1.0.0.

3. Install the R package bookdown:

````{r, eval=FALSE}
# stable version on CRAN
install.packages('bookdown')
# or development version on GitHub
# devtools::install_github('rstudio/bookdown')
```

4. look for a file called `_bookdown.yml` and add `output_dir: "docs"`

Exemple : 

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
book_filename: "YOUR BOOK NAME HERE"
delete_merged_file: true
language:
  ui:
    chapter_name:
output_dir: "docs"
```

5. Create a folder called `docs`

## Github Repository 

Create a repository on Github where you will host your Bookdown.
